ABOUT:
===============================
This module takes any score parsed and represented in music21
(which can come from several different formats)
and writes to the music21's 'tinyNotation':
a string representation of sheet music limited to basic elements (notes, rests, ...).

This module is needed because
music21 uses `tinyNotation` as input only:
there is no write-to-tiny functionality there.
The module is useful because often it's easiest to create some version of a score in a music notation editor first,
but then also to have a very basic, lightweight representation suitable for version control and more.

Tiny notation is deliberately limited in scope (otherwise it wouldn't be tiny!)
and we further limit the scope here (in the `Chorale-corpus`) to cases relevant to our purposes (chorales).

For instance, we are limited to:
- one tiny-notation string per part
- one time signature per score (set at the beginning)

For extensions and workarounds, see uses in the individual corpora.
